USING PERIODIC COMMIT 50

### Creates all nodes from the CSV, you need add one FOREACH clause for each node type, which is possible in the CSV
USING PERIODIC COMMIT 50
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///javaConceptsToIntent.csv" AS Line 
WITH Line
WHERE Line.`node type` IS NOT NULL
FOREACH(ignoreMe IN CASE WHEN Line.`node type` = 'term' THEN [1] ELSE [] END | MERGE (n:term {name:Line.name}) SET n.nodeid = Line.`node id`)

# Create relationship among intent-intent, term-term and term-intent

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///javaConceptsToIntent.csv" AS Line

### Create term-intent relations

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///javaConceptsToIntent.csv" AS Line
WITH Line
WHERE Line.`node type` IS NOT NULL
MATCH (n:term {name:Line.name})
MATCH (pn:intent {nodeid:Line.`parent node id`})

### Create term-term relations

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///javaConceptsToIntent.csv" AS Line
WITH Line
WHERE Line.`node type` IS NOT NULL
MATCH (n:term {name:Line.name})
MATCH (pn:term {nodeid:Line.`parent node id`})
